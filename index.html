                <p>Having suffered from severe heel pain every morning for some time, with no signs of any improvement or help from my GP, it was The London Foot Clinic who gave me hope. With rounds of Shockwave Therapy and custom fitted orthotics, my feet have never felt better. With first class service and care the team.</p>

                <p> I recently had my surgery with Mr Kaser Nazir and couldn’t be more pleased with the results. I hardly experienced any pain following the procedure, and have had a smooth recovery following Mr Nazir’s advice. The rest of staff who have looked after me at the clinic during my follow-up appointments have been amazing </p>
